# Project3

This was the third project during the course Graphic Computation and Interfaces.
The objective was to explore the phong and gouraud lighting, with multiple factors, like ambient, diffuse and specular light.
The project is a tank that moves on a plane, can rotate it's upper parts, and can shoot tomatoes. 
In the help panel you can find other functions of the project.
The help panel can be toggled by pressing 'h'.

This project got the grade 18,9 in a scale from 0 to 20.

I used VS Code with the extension "Live Server" by "Ritwick Dey".
