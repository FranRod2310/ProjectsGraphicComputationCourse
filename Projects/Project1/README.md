# Project1

This was my first project during the course Graphic Computation and Interfaces.
The objective was to explore the shaders and see how they work.
The project shows 6 different mathematical curves with bouncing balls, the points belonging to the curve change the pixel dimension when a ball is underneath them. 
In the help panel you can find other functions of the project.
The help panel can be toggled by pressing 'h'.

This project got the grade 20 in a scale from 0 to 20.

I used VS Code with the extension "Live Server" by "Ritwick Dey".
