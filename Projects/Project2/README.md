# Project2

This was the second project during the course Graphic Computation and Interfaces.
The objective was to explore the different types of views, and projections, with hierarchical structure. 
The project is a tank that moves on a plane, can rotate it's upper parts, and can shoot tomatoes. 
In the help panel you can find other functions of the project.
The help panel can be toggled by pressing 'h'.

This project got the grade 19,5 in a scale from 0 to 20.

I used VS Code with the extension "Live Server" by "Ritwick Dey".
